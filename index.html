    <p><strong>Anti-Discrimination Notice.</strong> It is illegal to
      discriminate against any work-authorized individual in hiring, discharge,
      recruitment or referral for a fee, or in the employment eligibility
      verification (Form I-9 and E-Verify) process based on that individual's
      citizenship status, immigration status or national origin.  Employers
      <strong>CANNOT</strong> specify which document(s) they will accept from an
      employee. The refusal to hire an individual because the documentation
      presented has a future expiration date may also constitute illegal
      discrimination. For more information, call the Office of Special Counsel
      for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices (OSC) at
      1-800-255-7688 (employees), 1-800-255-8155 (employers), or 1-800-237-2515

    <h3>What Is the Purpose of This Form?</h3>
    <p>Employers must complete Form I-9 to document verification of the identity
      and employment authorization of each new employee (both citizen and
      noncitizen) hired after November 6, 1986, to work in the United States.
      In the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), employers
      must complete Form I-9 to document verification of the identity and
      employment authorization of each new employee (both citizen and
      noncitizen) hired after November 27, 2011. Employers should have used
      Form I-9 CNMI between November 28, 2009 and November 27, 2011.</p>

    <h3>General Instructions</h3>
    <p>Employers are responsible for completing and retaining Form I-9. For the
      purpose of completing this form, the term
      "employer" means all employers, including those recruiters and referrers
      for a fee who are agricultural associations,
      agricultural employers, or farm labor contractors.</p>

    <p>Form I-9 is made up of three sections. Employers may be fined if the form
      is not complete. Employers are responsible for
      retaining completed forms. Do not mail completed forms to U.S.
      Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) or
      Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>

    <h3>Section 1. Employee Information and Attestation</h3>

    <p>Newly hired employees must complete and sign Section 1 of Form I-9
      <strong>no later than the first day of employment.</strong>
      Section 1 should never be completed before the employee has accepted a
      job offer.</p>

    <p>Provide the following information to complete Section 1:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Name</dt>
      <dd>Provide your full legal last name, first name, and middle initial.
      Your last name is your family name or
      surname. If you have two last names or a hyphenated last name, include
      both names in the last name field. Your first
      name is your given name. Your middle initial is the first letter of your
      second given name, or the first letter of your
      middle name, if any.</dd>

      <dt>Other names used</dt>
      <dd>Provide all other names used, if any (including maiden name). If you
      have had no other legal
      names, write "N/A."</dd>

      <dt>Address</dt>
      <dd>Provide the address where you currently live, including Street
      Number and Name, Apartment Number (if
      applicable), City, State, and Zip Code. Do not provide a post office box
      address (P.O. Box). Only border commuters
      from Canada or Mexico may use an international address in this
      field.</dd>

      <dt>Date of Birth</dt>
      <dd>Provide your date of birth in the mm/dd/yyyy format. For example,
      January 23, 1950, should be
      written as 01/23/1950.</dd>

      <dt>U.S. Social Security Number</dt>
      <dd>Provide your 9-digit Social Security number. Providing your Social
      Security number
      is voluntary. However, if your employer participates in E-Verify, you
      must provide your Social Security number.</dd>

      <dt>E-mail Address and Telephone Number (Optional)</dt>
      <dd>You may provide your e-mail address and telephone
      number. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may contact you if DHS
      learns of a potential mismatch between
      the information provided and the information in DHS or Social Security
      Administration (SSA) records. You may write
      "N/A" if you choose not to provide this information.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>All employees must attest in Section 1, under penalty of perjury, to
      their citizenship or immigration status by checking
      one of the following four boxes provided on the form:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>A citizen of the United States</strong></li>

      <li><strong>A noncitizen national of the United States:</strong>
        Noncitizen nationals of the United States are persons born in
        American Samoa, certain former citizens of the former Trust
        Territory of the Pacific Islands, and certain children of noncitizen
        nationals born abroad.</li>

      <li><strong>A lawful permanent resident:</strong>
        A lawful permanent resident is any person who is not a U.S. citizen
        and who resides in the United States under legally recognized and
        lawfully recorded permanent residence as an immigrant. The term
        "lawful permanent resident" includes conditional residents. If you
        check this box, write either your Alien Registration Number
        (A-Number) or USCIS Number in the field next to your selection. At
        this time, the USCIS Number is the same as the A-Number without the
        "A" prefix.</li>

      <li>
        <p><strong>An alien authorized to work:</strong>
          If you are not a citizen or national of the United States or a
          lawful permanent resident, but are authorized to work in the United
          States, check this box.</p>

        <p>If you check this box:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Record the date that your employment authorization expires,
            if any. Aliens whose employment authorization does not
            expire, such as refugees, asylees, and certain citizens of
            the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the
            Marshall Islands, or Palau, may write "N/A" on this
            line.</li>

          <li>Next, enter your Alien Registration Number (A-Number)/USCIS
            Number. At this time, the USCIS Number is the same as your
            A-Number without the "A" prefix. If you have not received an
            A-Number/USCIS Number, record your Admission Number. You can
            find your Admission Number on Form I-94, "Arrival-Departure
            Record," or as directed by USCIS or U.S. Customs and Border
            Protection (CBP).

            <ol>
              <li>If you obtained your admission number from CBP in
                connection with your arrival in the United States,
                then also record information about the foreign
                passport you used to enter the United States (number
                and country of issuance).</li>

              <li>If you obtained your admission number from USCIS
                within the United States, or you entered the United
                States without a foreign passport, you must write
                "N/A" in the Foreign Passport Number and Country of
                Issuance fields.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Sign your name in the "Signature of Employee" block and record the date
      you completed and signed Section 1. By signing and dating this form, you
      attest that the citizenship or immigration status you selected is
      correct and that you are aware that you may be imprisoned and/or fined
      for making false statements or using false documentation when completing
      this form. To fully complete this form, you must present to your
      employer documentation that establishes your identity and employment
      authorization. Choose which documents to present from the Lists of
      Acceptable Documents, found on the last page of this form. You must
      present this documentation no later than the third day after beginning
      employment, although you may present the required documentation before
      this date.</p>

    <h4>Preparer and/or Translator Certification</h4>
    <p>The Preparer and/or Translator Certification must be completed if the
      employee requires assistance to complete Section 1 (e.g., the employee
      needs the instructions or responses translated, someone other than the
      employee fills out the information blocks, or someone with disabilities
      needs additional assistance). The employee must still sign Section
      1.</p>

    <h4>Minors and Certain Employees with Disabilities (Special Placement)</h4>
    <p>Parents or legal guardians assisting minors (individuals under 18) and
      certain employees with disabilities should review the guidelines in the
      <em>Handbook for Employers: Instructions for
        Completing Form I-9 (M-274)</em> on
      <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central">www.uscis.gov/ I-9Central</a>
      before completing Section 1. These individuals have special procedures
      for establishing identity if they cannot present an identity document
      for Form I-9. The special procedures include <strong>(1)</strong> the
      parent or legal guardian filling out Section 1 and writing "minor under
      age 18" or "special placement," whichever applies, in the employee
      signature block; and<strong>(2)</strong> the employer writing "minor
      under age 18" or "special placement" under List B in Section 2.</p>

    <p>Before completing Section 2, employers must ensure that Section 1 is
      completed properly and on time. Employers may not ask an individual to
      complete Section 1 before he or she has accepted a job offer.</p>

    <p>Employers or their authorized representative must complete Section 2 by
      examining evidence of identity and employment authorization within 3
      business days of the employee's first day of employment. For example, if
      an employee begins employment on Monday, the employer must complete
      Section 2 by Thursday of that week. However, if an employer hires an
      individual for less than 3 business days, Section 2 must be completed no
      later than the first day of employment. An employer may complete Form
      I-9 before the first day of employment if the employer has offered the
      individual a job and the individual has accepted.</p>

    <p>Employers cannot specify which document(s) employees may present from the
      Lists of Acceptable Documents, found on the last page of Form I-9, to
      establish identity and employment authorization. Employees must present
      one selection from List A <strong>OR</strong> a combination of one
      selection from List B and one selection from List C. List A contains
      documents that show both identity and employment authorization. Some
      List A documents are combination documents. The employee must present
      combination documents together to be considered a List A document. For
      example, a foreign passport and a Form I-94 containing an endorsement of
      the alien's nonimmigrant status must be presented together to be
      considered a List A document. List B contains documents that show
      identity only, and List C contains documents that show employment
      authorization only. If an employee presents a List A document, he or she
      should <strong>not</strong> present a List B and List C document, and
      vice versa. If an employer participates in E-Verify, the List B document
      must include a photograph.</p>

    <p>In the field below the Section 2 introduction, employers must enter the
      last name, first name and middle initial, if any, that the employee
      entered in Section 1. This will help to identify the pages of the form
      should they get separated.</p>

    <p>Employers or their authorized representative must:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Physically examine each original document the employee presents to
        determine if it reasonably appears to be genuine and to relate to
        the person presenting it. The person who examines the documents must
        be the same person who signs Section 2. The examiner of the
        documents and the employee must both be physically present during
        the examination of the employee's documents.</li>

      <li>
        <p>Record the document title shown on the Lists of Acceptable
          Documents, issuing authority, document number and
          expiration date (if any) from the original document(s) the
          employee presents. You may write "N/A" in any unused
          fields.</p>

        <p>If the employee is a student or exchange visitor who presented a
          foreign passport with a Form I-94, the employer should also
          enter in Section 2:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>The student's Form I-20 or DS-2019 number (Student and
            Exchange Visitor Information System-SEVIS Number);
            <strong>and</strong> the program end date from Form I-20 or
            DS-2019.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>Under Certification, enter the employee's first day of employment.
        Temporary staffing agencies may enter the first day the employee was
        placed in a job pool. Recruiters and recruiters for a fee do not
        enter the employee's first day of employment.</li>

      <li>Provide the name and title of the person completing Section 2 in the
        Signature of Employer or Authorized Representative field.</li>

      <li>Sign and date the attestation on the date Section 2 is
        completed.</li>

      <li>Record the employer's business name and address.</li>

      <li>Return the employee's documentation.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Employers may, but are not required to, photocopy the document(s)
      presented. If photocopies are made, they should be made for
      <strong>ALL</strong> new hires or reverifications. Photocopies must be
      retained and presented with Form I-9 in case of an inspection by DHS or
      other federal government agency. Employers must always complete Section
      2 even if they photocopy an employee's document(s). Making photocopies
      of an employee's document(s) cannot take the place of completing Form
      I-9. Employers are still responsible for completing and retaining Form
      I-9.</p>

    <h4>Unexpired Documents</h4>

    <p>Generally, only unexpired, original documentation is acceptable. The only
      exception is that an employee may present a certified copy of a birth
      certificate. Additionally, in some instances, a document that appears to
      be expired may be acceptable if the expiration date shown on the face of
      the document has been extended, such as for individuals with temporary
      protected status. Refer to the <em>Handbook for Employers: Instructions
        for Completing Form I-9 (M-274)</em> or I-9 Central (<a
        href="http://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central">www.uscis.gov/I-9Central</a>)
      for examples.</p>

    <h4>Receipts</h4>
    <p>If an employee is unable to present a required document (or documents),
      the employee can present an acceptable receipt in lieu of a document
      from the Lists of Acceptable Documents on the last page of this form.
      Receipts showing that a person has applied for an initial grant of
      employment authorization, or for renewal of employment authorization,
      are not acceptable. Employers cannot accept receipts if employment will
      last less than 3 days. Receipts are acceptable when completing Form I-9
      for a new hire or when reverification is required.</p>

    <p>Employees must present receipts within 3 business days of their first
      day of employment, or in the case of reverification, by the date
      that reverification is required, and must present valid replacement
      documents within the time frames described below.</p>

    <p>There are three types of acceptable receipts:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A receipt showing that the employee has applied to replace a
        document that was lost, stolen or damaged. The employee must present
        the actual document within 90 days from the date of hire.</li>

      <li>The arrival portion of Form I-94/I-94A with a temporary I-551 stamp
        and a photograph of the individual. The employee must present the
        actual Permanent Resident Card (Form I-551) by the expiration date
        of the temporary I-551 stamp, or, if there is no expiration date,
        within 1 year from the date of issue.</li>

      <li>The departure portion of Form I-94/I-94A with a refugee admission
        stamp. The employee must present an unexpired Employment
        Authorization Document (Form I-766) or a combination of a List B
        document and an unrestricted Social Security card within 90
        days.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>When the employee provides an acceptable receipt, the employer
      should:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Record the document title in Section 2 under the sections titled
        List A, List B, or List C, as applicable.</li>

      <li>Write the word "receipt" and its document number in the "Document
        Number" field. Record the last day that the
        receipt is valid in the "Expiration Date" field.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>By the end of the receipt validity period, the employer should:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Cross out the word "receipt" and any accompanying document
        number and expiration date.</li>

      <li>Record the number and other required document information
        from the actual document presented.</li>

      <li>Initial and date the change.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>See the <em>Handbook for Employers: Instructions for Completing Form I-9
        (M-274)</em> at <a
        href="http://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central">www.uscis.gov/I-9Central</a>
      for more information on receipts.</p>

    <h3>Section 3. Reverification and Rehires</h3>

    <p>Employers or their authorized representatives should complete Section 3
      when reverifying that an employee is authorized to work. When rehiring
      an employee within 3 years of the date Form I-9 was originally
      completed, employers have the option to complete a new Form I-9 or
      complete Section 3. When completing Section 3 in either a reverification
      or rehire situation, if the employee's name has changed, record the name
      change in Block A.</p>

    <p>For employees who provide an employment authorization expiration date in
      Section 1, employers must reverify employment authorization on or before
      the date provided.</p>

    <p>For employees who provide an employment authorization expiration date in
      Section 1, employers must reverify employment authorization on or before
      the date provided.</p>

    <p>Some employees may write "N/A" in the space provided for the expiration
      date in Section 1 if they are aliens whose employment authorization does
      not expire (e.g., asylees, refugees, certain citizens of the Federated
      States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, or Palau).
      Reverification does not apply for such employees unless they chose to
      present evidence of employment authorization in Section 2 that contains
      an expiration date and requires reverification, such as Form I-766,
      Employment Authorization Document.</p>

    <p>Reverification applies if evidence of employment authorization (List A or
      List C document) presented in Section 2 expires. However, employers
      should not reverify:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>U.S. citizens and noncitizen nationals; or</li>
      <li>Lawful permanent residents who presented a Permanent Resident Card
        (Form I-551) for Section 2.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Reverification does not apply to List B documents.</p>

    <p>If both Section 1 and Section 2 indicate expiration dates triggering the
      reverification requirement, the employer should
      reverify by the earlier date.</p>

    <p>For reverification, an employee must present unexpired documentation
      from either List A or List C showing he or she is
      still authorized to work. Employers CANNOT require the employee to
      present a particular document from List A or List
      C. The employee may choose which document to present.</p>

    <p>To complete Section 3, employers should follow these instructions:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Complete Block A if an employee's name has changed at the time you complete Section 3.</li>

      <li>Complete Block B with the date of rehire if you rehire an employee
        within 3 years of the date this form was originally completed, and
        the employee is still authorized to be employed on the same basis as
        previously indicated on this form.  Also complete the "Signature of
        Employer or Authorized Representative" block.</li>

      <li>Complete Block C if:
        <ol>
          <li>The employment authorization or employment authorization
            document of a current employee is about to expire and
            requires reverification; or</li>

          <li>You rehire an employee within 3 years of the date this form
            was originally completed and his or her employment
            authorization or employment authorization document has
            expired. (Complete Block B for this employee as well.)</li>
        </ol>

        <p>To complete Block C:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Examine either a List A or List C document the employee
            presents that shows that the employee is currently
            authorized to work in the United States; and</li>

          <li>Record the document title, document number, and expiration
            date (if any).</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>After completing block A, B or C, complete the "Signature of
          Employer or Authorized Representative" block,
          including the date.</p>

        <p>For reverification purposes, employers may either complete
          Section 3 of a new Form I-9 or Section 3 of the previously
          completed Form I-9. Any new pages of Form I-9 completed during
          reverification must be attached to the employee's original Form
